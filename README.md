# SesamoHackathon -- Virtual Scholar Agent System

This repository contains a **multi-agent workflow** designed to function as a *virtual scholar agent*. The system automates summarizing team documents, analyzing research opportunities, retrieving relevant academic papers, and generating actionable insights for research teams.

## Overview
The **Virtual Scholar Agent System** operates on a daily, weekly, or monthly basis to streamline knowledge synthesis and research strategy for teams.

### Key Workflow Steps

1. **Centralized Upload Step**
   - Internal team documents are uploaded to a centralized folder.
   - Documents must be well-organized and tagged with metadata (e.g., project name, date).

2. **Project Context Agent**
   - Summarizes internal team documents under predefined categories:
     - **Research Framework & Key Concepts**
     - **Critical Analysis & Improvement Areas**
     - **Research Gaps & Extension Opportunities**
     - **Literature Review Strategy**: Keywords for paper search
   - Highlights **new information** compared to the previous weekâ€™s documents.
   - Generates a set of optimized, refined **keywords** for paper retrieval.

3. **Summary Project Context Agent**
   - Aggregates individual summaries while avoiding redundant insights.

4. **Rough Paper Retrieval Agent**
   - Fetches the latest academic papers (e.g., published in the past month) using the refined keywords.
   - Includes a **scoring mechanism** for relevance, based on metrics such as:
     - Download count / Citation count (For latest papers maybe only using download count )
     - Abstract similarity

5. **Granular Paper Retrieval Agent**
   - Matches paper embeddings against internal team documents for deeper **context alignment**.
   - Suggests tiered relevance levels:
     - **Highly Relevant**
     - **Moderately Relevant**

6. **Counseling Agent**
   - Summarize how each selected papers could help improve the projects

7. **Final Output**
   - A clear, categorized report that includes:
     - Summarized internal context
     - Highlighted research gaps and improvement areas
     - Refined keywords for literature search
     - Annotated external papers with actionable insights and tiered relevance levels
    

## Features
- **Automated Document Analysis**: Extracts and summarizes key research points from internal documents.
- **Change Detection**: Highlights new insights compared to previous document versions.
- **Keyword Optimization**: Generates refined keywords for precise literature search.
- **Relevance Scoring**: Assesses external papers based on citation count and content similarity.
- **Contextual Paper Filtering**: Embedding-based matching for deeper alignment.
- **Actionable Insights**: Annotates external papers with follow-up recommendations.
- **Flexible Scheduling**: Runs daily, weekly, or monthly depending on team needs.

## Installation
1. **Create a Virtual Environment**:
   Run the following command to create a virtual environment named `venv`:
   ```bash
   python3 -m venv venv
   ```

2. **Activate the Virtual Environment**:
   After creating the virtual environment, activate it using the following command:

   On macOS and Linux:
   ```bash
   source venv/bin/activate
   ```
   On Windows:
   ```
   .\venv\Scripts\activate
   ```

3. **Install the Required Packages**:
   Once the virtual environment is activated, install the required packages using the `requirements.txt` file:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

4. **Set Up Centralized Folder**:
   Upload team documents to the `data/team_docs/` directory for analysis.

5. **Configure API Keys**:
   - For paper retrieval, integrate APIs such as Semantic Scholar, arXiv, or other academic databases.
   - Add your **OpenAI API Key** to a `.env` file in the project directory. The `.env` file should include the following:
     ```plaintext
     OPENAI_API_KEY=your_openai_api_key_here
     ```
   - Ensure that the system reads this key during execution.

## Usage
- **Run the Main Application**:
   To run the main application with a UI, use the following command:
   ```bash
   python app.py
   ```
   After running, access the application in your browser at: [http://127.0.0.1:5000](http://127.0.0.1:5000).

   - Upload your files via the UI.
   - Click on **'Start Analysis'** to begin the analysis.
   - Once the analysis is complete, download the results directly from the UI.
   - Use the chatbot feature to ask questions about internal or external papers.

- **Run Offline Analysis**:
   To analyze team documents offline without the UI, run:
   ```bash
   python scripts/analyze_team_docs.py
   ```
   
The system will:
- Summarize internal documents.
- Retrieve relevant papers.
- Generate research insights and feedback.

Results will be saved in the `output/` folder.

## Outputs
The system generates a structured report including:
1. **Summarized Internal Context**
2. **Highlighted Research Gaps & Opportunities**
3. **Optimized Keywords for Literature Search**
4. **Annotated External Papers**
   - Tiered relevance levels
   - Follow-up actions and collaboration recommendations

## Future Enhancements
### Internal Artifacts Review
- Enable **multimodal data ingestion** to analyze various types of data, including:
   - Text documents (current implementation)
   - Images and diagrams (e.g., flowcharts, annotated graphs)
   - Audio and video content (e.g., meeting recordings, presentations)
- Generate insights that combine analysis across multiple data modalities for richer understanding.

### External Paper Retrieval
- **Scale search to multiple academic repositories and websites**:
   - Add support for databases such as IEEE Xplore, Springer, PubMed, and others.
   - Implement aggregation mechanisms to prioritize search results across platforms.
- Introduce **adaptive search strategies** to optimize queries dynamically based on project needs.

### Project Improvement Recommendation
- Enhance recommendation capabilities by:
   - Suggesting **proactive collaboration opportunities** with authors of relevant external papers.
   - Incorporating **trend analysis** to predict upcoming research directions and topics based on retrieved papers.
   - Providing **visualizations** of research gaps, collaboration pathways, and key insights for easier interpretation.
